Visualization: Using charts to illustrate customer segments and their value.

Results:

The analysis identifies key segments such as 'Champions', 'Loyal Customers', and 'At Risk', providing insights for targeted marketing.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how RFM analysis can uncover valuable customer insights. 
Future improvements could include integrating additional customer data and exploring machine learning models for predictive analytics.
